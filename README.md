Practice using I/O input validation and using random number generation.

Implements the game of rock, paper, scissors. Players randomly select rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. If both players choose the same they choose again until someone wins. Human vs computer, after the game is done, there is an option to play again.
